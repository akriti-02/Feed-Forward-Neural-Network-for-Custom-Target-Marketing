# Feed-Forward-Neural-Network-for-Custom-Target-Marketing
Here's a `README.md` file draft for your "Neural Network for Customer Target Marketing" project:

## Overview

This project uses a Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN) to predict customer responses to targeted marketing campaigns. By analyzing features such as purchase frequency, recency, and transaction values, the model identifies customers likely to engage with campaigns, enabling improved marketing strategies and customer segmentation. The model is trained on Kaggle's [Uplift Modeling, Marketing and Campaign Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aminghias/targeted-marketing), which includes anonymized features and binary labels to optimize campaign targeting.

## Objectives

1. Build a robust FFNN model to predict customer responses to marketing campaigns.
2. Evaluate model performance through metrics like precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.
3. Visualize performance metrics, including loss and accuracy curves.
4. Validate model performance on unseen data to ensure robustness.

## Model Architecture

The model is a Feedforward Neural Network with:
- **Input Layer**: 16 features
- **Hidden Layers**: Three layers with ReLU activations, dropout for regularization, and L2 regularization
- **Output Layer**: Softmax activation for multi-class classification

## Evaluation

The model's performance is assessed using:
- **Confusion Matrix** for class-wise accuracy
- **Precision, Recall, and F1-Score**
- **ROC-AUC** for overall effectiveness
- **Learning Curves** (loss vs. epoch, accuracy vs. epoch)

## Results

The FFNN model demonstrates strong accuracy, achieving an F1-score of 97.69% and a recall of 96.24%. Evaluation plots show robust learning with no signs of overfitting, and insights from feature analysis suggest valuable applications in marketing segmentation.
